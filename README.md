# 🦊 Lox Interpreter

This repository contains two implementations of the [Lox language](Lox.md) from the book *Crafting Interpreters*:

- **CLox** — A tree-walk bytecode interpreter written in C.
- **JLox** — A tree-walk interpreter written in Java.

The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of interpreter design by implementing Lox in two different styles and languages.
